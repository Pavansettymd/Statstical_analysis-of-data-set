# Statstical_analysis-of-data-set
Statistical analysis is a fundamental aspect of data science and machine learning. By understanding and applying statistical methods, you can derive meaningful insights from datasets, make predictions, and inform decision-making. In this session, we will explore the basics of statistical analysis using Python, leveraging libraries like pandas, numpy, and scipy. We will use various datasets, including the built-in Diabetes dataset from the sklearn library, and explore how to apply statistical methods to datasets from sources like Kaggle and the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
